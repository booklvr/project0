# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

My simple project has four pages.

Index.html:  Introduces the website with a navbar and a footer that disapears on small screans.

Plants.html:  Displays a list of the plants I have at home.

Water.html: Displays a table of my watering schedule at home.

Contact.html is just a grid with my different contacts. (the links are not active).
